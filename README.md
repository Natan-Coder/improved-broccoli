# improved-broccoli

Hello world, I guess you could say this is the start of something messy, memorable, and beautiful in the form of my coding journey

---
# About me
Honestly, I have nothing to hide from you, I'm eager to prove to myself and to others that I have the skills to be a developer. My ball and chain is my responsibility to working a full-time job to *barely cover the bills.* I've never been afraid to put in the hard work to accomplish my goals. I love to research and troubleshoot problems until the cows come home. 

# Why Github?
My coding journey started roughly a year and a half ago with python and SQL. I had a hellish professor who taught SQL, I passed his class, so I'm confident in what I bring to the table regarding those skills and MS SQL. Python started as a hobby and has now turned into an obsession; all I can think about is all the different projects I would love to accomplish. 
Unfortunate but truthfully, I'm still lacking experience at starting my own project from conception to execution. Which is why I am making an attempt at being more active and contributive on Github. I will make mistakes as I am still new at this, but with each mistake my skills and my craft improve which is better for you in the long run. 

Thank you for taking the time to view my proposal, I hope we will be working together in the future.
